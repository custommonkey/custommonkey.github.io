<h1>Health and Safety</h1>

<h2>Child protection policy</h2>
<p>Wakaba Kendo Club has signed up to and complies with the <a target="_top" href="http://www.kendo.org.uk/">BKA</a>'s <a href="http://www.kendo.org.uk/memberinfo/clubinfo/child_protectionv2.pdf">Child
Protection Policy</a>
</p>
<p>For the purpose of Wakaba's dojo policy, a child is any person under 18 years
of age.</p>
<p>Children's practice is organised and supervised by qualified coaches who have
completed <a target="_top" href="http://www.kendo.org.uk/">BKA</a> Coach Level Two, with the practice methods monitored and approved
by the chief instructor.</p>
<p>Because kendo is a physical activity that involves direct contact, we make a
conscious effort to provide a safe, positive and nurturing environment where
children can develop and enhance their physical and social skills. Everybody
involved in Wakaba is aware that abuse, whether physical, psychological or
sexual is wrong, severely damages children and must be confronted.</p>
<p>For the purpose of safety and child protection, instructors and coaches are
aware of the requirement not to spend excessive time alone with children away
from others, without the full consent and knowledge of other instructors. Even
when there is a need for children to practice separately, the practice will be
organised and supervised by at least two instructors or coaches. When there is a
need for children to move from one section of the venue to another, say, from
the main sport hall to the dance studio, again children will be escorted through
by at least two instructors or coaches.</p>
<p>However we also encourage parents and guardians to be present during the
practice so that they are aware of the nature of the practice and can support
their child. Instructors and coaches cannot always supervise events in the
changing rooms and toilets, in particular during the practice time. While it is
our policy to ensure that children are supervised during toilet trips, in
reality we often have to ask parents to escort the child. Again parents/
guardians have the primary responsibility for the care and welfare of their
children.</p>
<p>(Police registration - to be cleared through the <a target="_top" href="http://www.kendo.org.uk/">BKA</a> by the end of the
year.)</p>
<p>Confidentiality - Wakaba Kendo Club takes care in treating personal
information in a careful and sensitive manner. For example, we take as much care
as possible to ensure that images of children are not taken by camera and video
without the consent of the parents. Please note that from time to time children
are photographed as a record of events and may be used for the purpose of
promotion of the club. If you object to this, please state it clearly in the
Membership Agreement form.</p>
